# Workflows chain a series of "boots" together. A host will
# attach itself to a single workflow. A single "boot" is a
# complete provisioning (bootloader & unattended config/install)
id: etcd-master
# or boot-order?
workflow:
  - boot: etcd-master
    next-boot: etcd-master # next-boot is self, also implicit, as last item
    # next-boot: wipe-disk # or go to first stage if rebooted
